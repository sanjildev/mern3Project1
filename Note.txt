CORS
CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
Sandbox – It is similar to when you open multiple tabs on a computer; each tab is isolated from the others. For example, if there is some data in one tab, that data won't be accessible from another tab — everything stays isolated.

SOP (Same-Origin Policy) — It requires three rules:

Same Protocol must be used.
Example: https://nics.com and https://nic.com — ✅ (protocol is the same but hostname differs).

Same Hostname must be used.
Example: https://nics.com and https://nic.com — ❌ (different hostnames).

Same Port Number must be used.
Example: https://nics.com running on port 4000 and https://nic.com running on port 5173 — ❌ (different ports).

Since SOP was very strict, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) was introduced.

CORS — Here, we can define a whitelist (allowing certain APIs) and a blacklist (blocking certain APIs). This means we can control which APIs are allowed access and which are denied.
